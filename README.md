# BetterCase

Better Case uses refinements to implement ´===´ in core clases to enable 
you to use case for cool stuff.

Array use ´include?´, Symbol use ´respond_to?´ to make duck typing.

To use it simply require and add `using BetterCase` on your module/class 
the rest of the code should never notice the change.

    gem 'better_case'
